To facilitate such transport modes, systems like bike-sharing, car-sharing, and shared autonomous cars are implemented. However, the systems mentioned above have traffic congestion, a lack of parking space availability, and on-demand service concerns. To address the aforementioned challenges, we intend to integrate an on-demand shared-use, self-driving cargo-bikes service (OSABS) as a new mode of transportation into the urban mobility ecosystem. The selection of energy supply technology for self-driving cargo bikes is essential for making the OSABS system more environment-friendly and sustainable. Therefore, this paper aims to identify a suitable energy supply technology for our self-driving cargo bikes. Following that, we compare each technology using key performance indicators (KPIs), such as service level, implementation cost, energy consumption cost, charging station utilization, and profit analysis. Furthermore, we use the agent-based simulation model to experiment with the identified energy supply technologies, such as battery-powered and hydrogen fuel cell-powered autonomous cargo bikes.

Internet of Things technologies can drastically improve the capabilities of the autonomous vehicle to better understand its environment with the interconnection of the surrounding elements. The findings from the development of the Internet of Things in autonomous cars are more intelligent mobility with higher levels of safety (for passengers and pedestrians), efficiency (allowing drivers to avoid traffic congestion and facilitating their search for parking), and sustainability (through reduced fuel consumption.). This article reviews advances on the Internet of Things and how it has changed the industry. Aspects in the development of intelligent cities result from implementing the Internet of Things.

Autonomous cars are one such application. This is expected to have a significant and revolutionary influence on society. Integration with smart cities, new infrastructure and urban planning with sophisticated cyber-security are some of the current ramifications of self-driving automobiles. The autonomous automobile, often known as self driving systems or driverless vehicles, is a vehicle that can perceive its surroundings and navigate predetermined routes without human involvement. Cars are on the verge of evolving into autonomous robots, thanks to significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and related technologies, and this will have a wide range of socio-economic implications. However, in order for these automobiles to become a reality, they must be endowed with the perception and cognition necessary to deal with high-pressure real-life events and make proper judgments and take appropriate action. The majority of self-driving car technologies are based on computer systems that automate vehicle control parts. From forward-collision warning and antilock brakes to lane-keeping and adaptive drive control, to fully automated driving, these technological components have a wide range of capabilities. A self-driving car combines a wide range of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Recent researches on computer vision and deep learning are used to control autonomous driving systems. For self-driving automobiles, lane-keeping is crucial. This study presents a deep learning approach to obtain the proper steering angle to maintain the robot in the lane. We propose an advanced control for a self driving robot by using two controllers simultaneously. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed, to predict the car' and a proportional integral-derivative (PID) controller is designed for speed and steering control. This study uses a Raspberry PI based camera to control the robot car.
