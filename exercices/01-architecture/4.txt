Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate university students' smartphone activities, their use and attitudes towards digital financial services, and to build a neural network model capable of distinguish-ing students according to their awareness of the benefits related to using online financial services. Methodology: An online questionnaire was applied to collect data on students' smartphone activity and their tendency to use online financial services. Depending on the variable type, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Kendall's tau-b were used to assess the association between variables, while multilayer perceptron and radial basis function neural networks were used for the creation of the optimal model. Results: Participants in this study achieved an average score of 6.56 (SD = 1.27) for smartphone activity, and the results showed that the optimal neural network model obtained had an overall accuracy of 70.73%. However, smartphone activity did not have an excessive effect on the efficiency of this model. Conclusion: The obtained neural network model and its sensitivity analysis managed to reveal some hid-den patterns which could be beneficial to educators in terms of improvements of students' digital and financial literacy as well as to the financial sector in terms of increasing performance and interest of this population in digital financial services.

This condition necessitates the use of combined water distribution to meet the full water requirements. Analysis of existing surface water resources and related restrictions, this research suggested an algorithm for aquifer stabilization and fulfilling optimum water requirements. To manage the optimum withdrawals and the subsequent drop, this technique first employed the MODFLOW model for simulating the water levels. Next, an improved feed-forward neural network (IFFNN) was combined with an optimization method to create a machine learning (ML) framework. During the last phase, the findings of the optimized connectives approach as well as the relevant fields technologies to determine using improved bald eagle search with least square SVM(IBES-LSSVM) method that predicted the level of water deficit for every period, especially during farming seasons. This approach is based on an improved bald eagle search (IBES) optimization technique for finding the best settings for a least-squares support vector ma-chine (LSSVM). The findings revealed that between 2005 and 2020, the year with the biggest water deficit was 2018 when only roughly 64 percent of water need was satisfied by groundwater (69 percent) and surface water (64 percent) (33 percent). The water depth may have risen by around 0.7 m during the study period if the optimum model had been used. The outcome of this research will help the management forecast future water shortages and make smarter water strategic choices.

In this regard, this study took advantage of the CanESM2 model to determine future climate of the region. The SDSM model was then adopted to perform downscaling the data produced by the CanESM2. The historical data (climate and hydrometric) were utilized to train networks to determine the amount of snowfall from precipitation as well as the flow regime based on the air temperature, snowfall, and rainfall data. The generated climate data were inputted into the neural network to determine how the changing climate would impact the flow of the Qu'Appelle River. Comparison of the results obtained under climate change and historical scenarios demonstrated that climate change is expected to result in heterogeneous alteration in precipitation and air temperature patterns causing substantial adverse impacts on the flow regime of the Qu'Appelle River.

This research aims to elucidate the significant impact of exercise on the learning processes within the manufacturing workforce, facilitated by the potent tool of big data analytics. A pioneering hybrid methodology is introduced, which seamlessly integrates neural network techniques with the intelligent water drops optimization algorithm. To rigorously evaluate this methodology, a performance evaluation dataset comprising 1,250 samples, each characterized by a diverse array of attributes, is utilized. The integrated approach combines two pivotal techniques: feature selection empowered by the intelligent water drops algorithm and classification executed through neural networks. The findings reveal an optimal neural network configuration featuring 11 neurons in the hidden layers, along with the selection of the Pure linear (purelin) transfer function and the Train using Scaled Conjugate Gradient (traincgb) training function. The implications of this methodology are profound, demonstrating a remarkable 22% improvement over the baseline method. This underscores the pivotal role of exercise and physical activity, accounting for approximately 68%, in enhancing the learning and efficiency of the workforce. Notably, this research transcends existing studies by providing a specialized lens through which the relationship between exercise, cognitive function, and learning within the realm of workforce planning is examined. Additionally, dataset performance is bolstered through the inclusion of 875 training samples, highlighting the critical importance of homogeneous parameters in achieving superior classification outcomes. In summary, this innovative artificial neural network methodology not only exhibits unparalleled performance in comparison to existing methods but also offers invaluable insights into enhancing workforce proficiency through the transformative capabilities of big data analytics.
