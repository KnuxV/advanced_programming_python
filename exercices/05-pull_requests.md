```bash
# Choose a descriptive name
git switch -c fix-typos-chapter3
# OR
git switch -c add-french-translation

## Contribution Ideas

**For the Website:**
- Add useful Python resources, links or explanations about the class
- Fix documentation errors
- Improve exercise instructions, suggest variants
- Add examples or clarifications

**For Shell, Git and Python Exercises:**
- Add translations (create branch like `french-translation` with a mention of the branch in the instructions)
- Clarify confusing instructions
- Add new practice exercises
- Fix bugs in existing exercises
- Provide solution guides
- Add "common mistakes" sections
- Create troubleshooting guides

## Example Pull Request Description
```markdown
## What I Changed
Fixed multiple typos and unclear instructions in the merge conflict exercise.

## Why This Helps
- Students were confused by step 4
- Several spelling errors made instructions hard to follow
- Added clearer examples for beginners

## Files Changed
- exercises/merge-conflict.md
- README.md (minor formatting)


```

## Important: PR Direction

You are creating a PR **from your feature branch to the original repository's main branch**:
- ‚úÖ `your-fork/feature-branch` ‚Üí `original-repo/main`
- ‚ùå NOT to your own main branch

You don't need to merge your feature branch into your main branch first!

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Basic workflow
git clone your-fork-url
cd repository-name
git switch -c your-branch-name
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Clear description of changes"
git push origin your-branch-name
# Then create PR on the website
```

## Tips for Success
- **Be specific**: Target one clear improvement, make several specific pull requests instead of a big complicated one. 
- **Test everything**: Make sure your changes work
- **Explain clearly**: Write good commit messages and PR descriptions
- **Start small**: Better to make a small, perfect contribution than a large, messy one A pull request must follow a thematic. If you are fixing typos, it's okay to target many different files because the theme is to fix typo. But don't fix typo and add a translation in the same pull request.
- **Focus on helping future students**: Think about what would be most useful

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Working directly on main branch instead of a feature branch
- Pushing untested changes
- Making PRs that are too large or unfocused
- Not explaining what you changed or why
