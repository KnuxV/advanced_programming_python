## Split Points:

### **File 1: Basics and Imports**
Start: Beginning of document
End: After "#### Parent Directory" section (line ending with `from parent_module import something`)

---

### **File 2: Packages**
Start: "## Working with Packages"
End: After the last code example in "### Package Code Example" section (ending with `return data is not None and len(str(data)) > 0`)

---

### **File 3: Building and Configuration**
Start: "### Installing Your Package Locally"
End: After "This creates two files in the `dist/` directory:" section (ending with `- `.whl` - Wheel (binary) distribution`)

---

### **File 4: Reference and Exercises**
Start: "## Publishing to PyPI: Theory and Concepts"
End: End of document

That's it! Each file is roughly balanced and logically complete.
