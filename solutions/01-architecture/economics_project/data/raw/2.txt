First, the algorithm is initialized with a positive definite function to ensure that the sequence of cost functions is monotonically nonincreasing. Then, the updating rules of the cost function, the costate function, and the tracking control law are provided in the framework of generalized value iteration. Moreover, the monotonicity and the admissibility analysis of the generalized iteration algorithm are given. The model network, the critic network, and the action network are introduced to facilitate the implementation of the algorithm. Finally, the evolving policies in the iterative process are adopted to adjust the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate nitrogen in the experimental simulation, which verifies that the proposed generalized GDHP-based optimal tracking control method is applicable online.

J	Long, F; Liu, H				Long, Fei; Liu, Hong			An integration of machine learning models and life cycle assessment for lignocellulosic bioethanol platforms	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Machine Learning; Life Cycle Assessment; Lignocellulosic Bioethanol; Ethanol Yield; Prediction and Optimization	ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; FERMENTATION CONDITIONS; ETHANOL-PRODUCTION; CORN STOVER; RICE STRAW; PRETREATMENT; BIOMASS; OPTIMIZATION; ENERGY; CHALLENGES	The availability and accuracy of data play a critical role in the development of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models, as they directly impact the effectiveness and reliability of the model. Machine learning (ML) approach has the potential to improve the data quality, leading to enhanced performance of LCA models. In this study, ML algorithms (random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural network) were applied to predict the ethanol yield and NaOH consumption, which were key life cycle inventories for lignocellulosic bioethanol process. The prediction models exhibited a decent level of accuracy for ethanol yield (accuracy similar to 0.85) and NaOH consumption (accuracy > 0.8). In addition, ML algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulate annealing) were applied to identify optimal feedstock characteristics and conditions for maximum ethanol yield. The optimization models showed an 18% improvement compared to the highest yield from the dataset (0.41 g/g). The ML models (prediction and optimization algorithms) were further integrated with the LCA model (GREET1) to enhance the ethanol yield and to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for target feedstocks. This resulted in a 6% and 19% improvement in ethanol yield and an approximately 8% and 14% reduction of GHG emissions for grass and corn stover, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing ML to predict LCA metrics for the development of LCA models and to optimize the process parameters to minimize environmental impact.

Advancements in building energy technologies have played a critical role in enhancing the energy sustainability of the built environment. Extensive research and new techniques in energy and environmental systems for buildings have recently emerged to address the global challenges. This study reviews existing articles in the literature, mostly since 2000, to explore technological advancement in building energy and environmental systems that can be applied to smart homes and buildings. This review study focuses on an overview of the design and implementation of energy-related smart building technologies, including energy management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart technologies for optimal function and energy-efficient performance. To review the advancement in building energy-related technologies, a systematic review process is adopted based on available published reviews and research types of articles. Review-type articles are first assessed to explore the current literature on the relevant keywords and to capture major research scopes. Research-type papers are then examined to investigate associated keywords and work scopes, including objectives, focuses, limitations, and future needs. Throughout the comprehensive literature review, this study identifies various techniques of smart home/building applications that have provided detailed solutions or guidelines in different applications to enhance the quality of people's daily activities and the sustainability of the built environmental system. This paper shows trends in human activities and technology advancements in digital solutions with energy management systems and practical designs. Understanding the overall energy flow between a building and its environmentally connected systems is also important for future buildings and community levels. This paper assists in understanding the pathway toward future smart homes/buildings and their technologies for researchers in related research fields.

It is one of the biggest carbon emitters, making it an aspect of environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation. Each stage of cement production releases CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. About 8% of worldwide CO2 emissions come from the cement sector, making it a major contributor. Different supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) like fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF), and slag are used to partially replace traditional raw materials like limestone, reducing the environmental impact. This study investigated the use of supplementary cementitious materials, specifically FA and alccofine (AF), as partial replacements for cement in concrete to reduce environmental impact. The study first identified an optimal replacement percentage for FA (20%, 30%, and 40%) by weight of cement. Subsequently, using the optimal FA percentage, AF was added at varying percentages (5%, 10%, and 15%) by weight of cement. The study evaluated the mechanical properties of the concrete mixtures, including workability, compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. Durability, measured by water sorptivity and rapid chloride penetrability tests, was also assessed. The microstructural properties of the concrete were analyzed to understand their influence on performance. As a result of the significant environmental implications of producing and using concrete for all activities, an in-depth life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted. Additionally, artificial neural networks were employed to predict the compressive strength of the concrete. The study concluded that incorporating FA and AF in concrete mixtures is a promising approach to producing more environmentally friendly concrete.
