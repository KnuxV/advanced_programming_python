The method is expected to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals with the improvement of the sustainability of the computational mechanics simulation itself. It is based on the controlled inexactness in the computational mechanics simulations, where partial differential equations are usually solved as accurately as possible. In particular, it not only reduces the power consumption but also gains in computation speed of computational mechanics simulations by actively introducing the low-precision computation, expanding the applicability of the low-precision computation while controlling the accuracy of computation results with the support of deep learning. The detailed formulation of the proposed method is given with some applications, and a couple of issues and potential of the method are discussed.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, researchers developed and implemented different mathematical tools to establish the accuracy of prediction. However, due to the complexity of data sets and high-order non-linearity among the individuals concerning different production traits, the accuracy of forecasting livestock productivity is a tedious job. With this context, the artificial neural network (ANN), a machine learning program, gained popularity in the field of animal science due to its robust and effective handling of the complexity of a large datasets. The present review aims to discuss the potential utility of artificial neural networks in the different fields of livestock farming for improving livestock productivity as well as for the efficient farm management practices for economic and sustainable livestock production.

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the implementation of an Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) for microgrids using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. Through simulation-based experiments, the performance of the RL-based system is evaluated and compared with traditional rule-based approaches across various metrics. Results indicate that the RL-based system achieves superior performance in energy efficiency, peak load management, battery utilization, cost savings, and environmental sustainability. Specifically, the system demonstrates a remarkable improvement in energy efficiency, achieving higher ratings and optimizing resource utilization compared to the baseline rule-based approach. Implementation of the RL-based system leads to substantial cost savings and an impressive return on investment (ROI), highlighting its financial viability and efficiency gains. Moreover, the system exhibits notable environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy integration, and promoting sustainability. The scalability and adaptability of the RL-based system make it suitable for deployment in various microgrid settings and applications. The findings underscore the significant potential of reinforcement learning-based approaches in revolutionizing microgrid operations, maximizing energy efficiency, reducing costs, and promoting environmental sustainability. These insights are valuable for policymakers, energy stakeholders, and researchers aiming to address the evolving challenges of modern energy systems and pave the way for a more sustainable energy future.
