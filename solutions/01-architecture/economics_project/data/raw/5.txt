Such forecasting requires a model that is not only accurate in predicting GWLs but also computationally efficient, ensuring its suitability for practical applications. In this study, a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is implemented to forecast GWLs for 17 monitoring wells possessing diverse hydrogeological characteristics, located across South Korea. Using deep learning, the influence of meteorological variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation) on the forecasted GWLs was investigated by dividing the input features into three categories. Additionally, the models were developed for three forecast intervals (at 1-, 3-, and 6-month lead times) using each category input. When compared with state-of-the-art models, that is, long short-term memory (LSTM) and artificial neural network (ANN), the TCN model showed superior performance and required much less computational complexity. On average, the TCN model outperformed the LSTM model by 24%, 21%, and 25%, and the ANN model by 24%, 37%, and 47%, respectively, for 1-, 3-, and 6-month lead times. Based on these results, the proposed TCN model can be used for real-time GWL forecasting in hydrological applications.

Pastoral complex is a construction mode of characteristic townships and rural complexes, which has become a new form of social development today. Pastoral complexes provide a new model of new rural construction, and its development is still in the preliminary stage for China. The construction of pastoral complexes involves rural landscape planning, economic management, etc. It is difficult for rural managers to process these complex data characteristics. Big data technology is affecting people's lives, and the discipline of landscape architecture is also deeply affected by big data. This paper mainly uses data mining technology and neural network method to carry out feature mining and prediction on the landscape planning and management methods of beautiful rural pastoral complexes. In this paper, a data mining algorithm is used to classify the landscape types and locations of rural complex, and the neural network method is used to predict the landscape characteristics. The results show that the methods of data mining and neural network are feasible and reliable both in the proportion of classification and in the prediction of landscape planning. The maximum error of the prediction of landscape design is 2.87%, and the minimum error is only 0.79% using the neural network method, which is an acceptable error range.

J	Aslan, E				Aslan, Emrah			Prediction and comparative analysis of emissions from gas turbines using random search optimization and different machine learning-based algorithms	BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						emission; gas turbines; efficiency; machine learning; random search optimization	PERFORMANCE	Gas turbines are widely used for power generation globally, and their greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly drawn public attention. Compliance with environmental regulations necessitates sophisticated emission measurement techniques and tools. Traditional sensors used for monitoring emission gases can provide inaccurate data due to malfunction or miscalibration. Accurate estimation of gas turbine emissions, such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, is crucial for assessing the environmental impact of industrial activities and power generation. This study used five different machine learning models to predict emissions from gas turbines, including AdaBoost, XGBoost, k-nearest neighbour, and linear and random forest models. Random search optimization was used to set the regression parameters. The findings indicate that the AdaBoost regressor model provides superior prediction accuracy for emissions compared to other models, with an accuracy of 99.97% and a mean squared error of 2.17 on training data. This research offers a practical modelling approach for forecasting gas turbine emissions, contributing to the reduction of air pollution in industrial applications.

J	Jin, X; Chang, BH; Han, CS; Uddin, MA				Jin, Xin; Chang, Bisharat Hussain; Han, Chaosheng; Uddin, Mohammed Ahmar			The tail connectedness among conventional, religious, and sustainable investments: An empirical evidence from neural network quantile regression approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS			English	Article						CoVaR; COVID-19; neural networks; religious investments; sustainable investments	OIL PRICES; SPILLOVER; RETURN; RISK; MARKETS; STOCKS	Financial markets are highly unpredictable and often associated with tail risks. This study examines the tail connectivity among three distinct markets-conventional, religious, and sustainable-and uses a new neural network quantile regression technique to quantify their risk exposure. The findings suggest that traditional and religious investments have the greatest tail risk exposure during crises, emphasising the importance of diversification using sustainable investments. The Systematic Network Risk Index identifies intense events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the European debt crisis, and the global financial crisis, as having the greatest tail risk. The Systematic Fragility Index finds the Islamic stocks during the COVID-19 crisis and the conventional stock market before the pandemic to the highly vulnerable markets. On the other hand, the Systemic Hazard Index identifies Islamic stocks as the primary source of systemic risk. The study concludes by providing implications for decision-makers, regulatory authorities, investors, players in the financial system, and investment managers to diversify their risk by utilising green/sustainable investments.
